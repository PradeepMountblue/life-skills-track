* ## [6.]() Paraphrase the video - Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise. Minimum 5 points.
    * Here are some paraphrased points from the video:

    * Exercise can lead to the production of growth factors that promote the development of new brain cells and the formation of new neural connections, which can improve cognitive function.

    * Exercise can increase blood flow to the brain, which can help to deliver more oxygen and nutrients to brain cells, and remove waste products.

    * Exercise can also promote the release of chemicals such as endorphins and serotonin, which can improve mood, reduce anxiety and depression, and promote feelings of well-being.

    * Regular exercise can also help to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults, by improving brain function and reducing the risk of conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity.

    * Even a small amount of exercise can have benefits for the brain, and the effects of exercise on the brain can be seen across the lifespan, from childhood to old age.
